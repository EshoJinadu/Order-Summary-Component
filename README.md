What I learned?
Being able to solve my third challenge on Frontmend mentor has given good edge into taking any challanges as well as projects, 
I am happy with my improvement.

This is my third challenge on frontend Mento, I learnt about positioning, borders, and more on padding and margin properties in CSS.
I also learned about transform and its property translate. I am getting more comfortable with css and I feel good about that.
